## Re-Run of LevelUpTuts Meteor for Everyone

This is going to be my 2nd run thru this tutorial.
The first time I didnt understand anything I was doing.
I then made it thru the Intermediate tutorial and some concepts are just starting sink in.

I am hoping going thru this agian will make alot more things "click".

I have also started working on my own projects.
